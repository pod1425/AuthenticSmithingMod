Authentic Smithing mod repo, i guess

Thanks for looking this up, mate. Here you can find many code examples and take anything for your peronal
usage. 

This mod is made primarily to test my own coding abilities. Heres list of all features i already implemented
and that you can use:

- Overriding/removing vanilla recipes with datagen (Credits to Xuul_)
  - Note: if you do everything exactly same way but it doesnt work, try changing mod id
- Automatic datagen. No need to call a bunch of same boring methods per each registry entry. In fact, you dont even need to open
the files to do default stuff. Note that this is made possible by changing the way you register your items. All you need
is in packages registry and datagen
